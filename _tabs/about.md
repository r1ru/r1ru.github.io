## About Me
Hi, I'm Riru Oda, an undergraduate student in Japan majoring in Computer Science. I love low-level programming and binary exploitation. In my free time, I develop system software such as OS kernels and hypervisors, and enjoy playing CTF (pwn). In my research, I focus on bug finding using static analysis. I share my knowledge on my blog.

## Experiences
- Security Camp 2022, 2023 – Student
- SecHack365 2023 – Participant
- Security Camp 2024 – Tutor
- Security Camp 2025 Next – Student
- Global Cybersecurity Camp 2025 Taiwan – Student 
- [TsukuCTF 2025](https://ctftime.org/event/2769/) – Author of Pwn challenges

## Projects
### [Binary Exploitation 101](https://r1ru.github.io/categories/binary-exploitation-101/)
The beginner-friendly guide to binary exploitation explains fundamental attack techniques such as Buffer Overflow and ROP (Return-Oriented Programming), with corresponding mitigations like SSP (Stack Smashing Protector) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and their bypass. It also covers modern mitigations such as Arm MTE and Intel CET, giving you insights into how programs work and the ideas behind attacks and defenses.

### [Linux Kenrel Exploitation](https://r1ru.github.io/categories/linux-kernel-exploitation/)
The blog series about advanced Linux kernel exploitation techniques such as DirtyPageTable and USMA (User Space Mapping Attack), lets you learn modern attack methods used in real-world Linux kernel exploitation through hands-on, CTF-like challenges.

### [WasmOS](https://github.com/r1ru/WasmOS)
A microkernel that can run WebAssembly in kernel space, written in C.

### [tiny-wasm-runtime](https://github.com/r1ru/tiny-wasm-runtime)
A WebAssembly interpreter written from scratch in C.

### [Symbolic Model Checker](https://github.com/r1ru/model-checker-from-scratch)
A BDD-based symbolic model checker written from scratch in Rust.

## Contact

I'm happy to connect via SNS or email. I'm also looking for opportunities such as internships or jobs related to binary security and system software development. Feel free to reach out.
